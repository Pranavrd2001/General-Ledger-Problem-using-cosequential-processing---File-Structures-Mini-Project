# File Structures Mini Project (18ISL67) - General Ledger Problem using Cosequential Processing
# 
## The Java file ledger.java contains the source code for the main ledger processing.
## **Prerequisites :** Requires 3 text files namely journal, ledger and finalledger. journal and ledger files are prepopulated with transaction data using the concept of variable record structure. A sample journal and ledger file are present in the folder for reference. Once the Post operation is performed the cosequential merge occurs and the merged data is stored in the finallledger text file. This is required to get the ledger printout.
